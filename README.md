# Guardians
This is the second game that I created for the Game Jam, so that my students would have a different thing to reference. It is inspired by magic and the teaching team. The first mini game is complete, but the pop up text is not implemented yet. The maze is a WIP as well aka the code is in it, but I need to debug it.
